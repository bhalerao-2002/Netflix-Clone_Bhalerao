# Netflix-Clone_Bhalerao

The Movie Fetching project is a ongoing endeavor that aims to create an improved clone of Netflix with enhanced functionalities. This web application fetches movies from the themoviedb.org database and provides a backend infrastructure that closely resembles Netflix. The frontend is implemented using HTML and CSS, while the backend is managed through the use of the themoviedb.org API. The project, based in Maharashtra, India, allows users to browse and access a wide range of movies similar to the popular streaming platform. To see a demonstration of the project, you can visit the provided GitHub and video links.
